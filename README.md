# Join Struphy developer meetings!

Struphy developer meetings happen on the **first Monday of each month** at **2 p.m. Berlin time**.

The **Zoom link** for the meeting will be published here 1-2 days before the meeting, and also sent out via the [Struphy mailing list](https://listserv.gwdg.de/mailman/listinfo/struphy). For developers on-site at the IPP Garching, we meet in the building D2, 2nd floor, L7 seminar room 201.
